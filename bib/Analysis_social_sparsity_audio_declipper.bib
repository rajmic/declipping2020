  abstract	= {We develop the analysis (cosparse) variant of the popular audio declipping algorithm of Siedenburg et al. Furthermore, we extend it by the possibility of weighting the time-frequency coefficients. We examine the audio reconstruction performance of several combinations of weights and shrinkage operators. We show that weights improve the reconstruction quality in some cases; however, the overall scores achieved by the non-weighted are not surpassed. Yet, the analysis Empirical Wiener (EW) shrinkage was able to reach the quality of a computationally more expensive competitor, the Persistent Empirical Wiener (PEW). Moreover, the proposed analysis variant using PEW slightly outperforms the synthesis counterpart in terms of an auditory-motivated metric.},
